# odin-recipes
This project will put into practice everything that I have learned so
far in this course. I will be creating a page that includes a list of
recipes that will link to those pages.

I will also be practicing using git to commit and push my work to my
GitHub repo so that I can have a safe copy of all my work.

I will write a recap after THIS:
---------------------------------
I created an index page that included links to 3 different recipes.

I created recipe pages for 3 different dishes.

I added and committed all of my changes to git, and pushed them to github.

I used github pages to publish my site.
